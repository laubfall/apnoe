# Apnoe
Apnoe is a static code analyzer tool mainly used to visualize call hierarchies of java code. Use it to get an idea about methods are involved in different runtime scenarios or just to impress some people with the complexity of your code :).

A good starting point is the GraphViewerApp. This application uses the GraphStreamer Library to visualize a call hierarchy graph.

## Status
Actually this is a work in progress project. The GraphViewerApp is under heavy development and far from finished but it gives you an idea what i try to achieve with apnoe.
